# Bugs

## I discovered a few bugs while working on this project.

1. When I added the bootstrap link rel="stylesheet" my css stylesheet stopped working.

## How did I solve this problem?

I simply moved the bootstrap link above my href="assets/css/style.css"
![Bug](testing/bug1.png)

2. Carousel control buttons for scrolling overlayed navigation bar preventing use of some navigation buttons
![Bug](testing/bug2-before.png)

## How did I solve this problem?

I added margin-top and width
.carousel-control-next, .carousel-control-prev {
    margin-top: 3rem;
    width: 30px;
}
![Bug](testing/bug2-after.png)

3. When the navigation bar was expanded on small screens, the carousel control arrows did not drop down with it, resulting arrows overlying navigation buttons

<p align="center">
 <img src="testing/Bug3-mobile.png">
</p>

## How did I solve this problem?

I couldn't figure out how to fix this problem so that I could keep the arrows when expanding the navigation bar on small screens.
My solution was to simply hide the arrow buttons and place a note beneath the gallery that said "Use the side screens to navigate."
